The Adventure Writing System (AWS) is a tool put together by Aristide Torrelli 
to easily write interactive fiction games.

Aristide describes his tool here: http://www.aristidetorrelli.it/aws3/Avventure.html

I thought it would have been fun to put together a converter that creates
a standard C source from the files produced by the AWS tool.

The obtained file can then be compiled to play the game :-)
